# Yunet Model Porting Example

This is a simple porting example of the Yunet model's C++ code to the EMGU.CV and OpenCvSharp4 libraries in C#. 
The Yunet model, originally developed in C++, can now be utilized seamlessly within C# applications using the combination of EMGU.CV and OpenCvSharp4. This project serves as a demonstration of how to achieve this integration and make the Yunet model accessible for your C# projects.
